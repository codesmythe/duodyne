		NAND1 -- first test of EPM7128S board
		
Under Windows 10, the directory NAND1 sits at the location:
   C:\altera\13.0sp1\NAND1\...
I don't know if you will need to place it at the exact same directory path.

All of the files below NAND1 were generated by Quartus II, 13.0sp1, the
last version of Quartus to support the MAX EPM7000 series from Altera, now
a part of Intel.

The file of most interest is the top level project file:  nand1.qpf
Open this project file and you should be able to find the simple NAND gate
schematic.  Inputs and Outputs are assigned to specific board pins.

You should be able to load this project into the 7128 without modification,
as long as your USB Blaster is properly recognized by Quartus II.

With the project board in landscape orientation, switches 1 and 2 on the upper
switch DIP control the two low order LEDs on the row above the 7128.  All
of the other LEDs on the board will be ON.  (I gather '0' is the default output
of the 7128 chip.)
