duodyne initial build and test findings

4-slot backplane power LED much too bright
4-slot backplane power connectors too close to processor slot

ROMRAM memory configuration jumpers flipped on PCB
ROMRAM order the I2C jumper blocks the same as the I2C sockets -- would be even better if they could be made proximate
ROMRAM add bypass capacitors to the 24LC512 I2C memories
ROMRAM replace labels on J32-J35 with better descriptions
ROMRAM label DS1210s to match SRAMs

Z80 processor remove spare debugging sockets, GAL, & portal holes
Z80 processor convert 74HCT244 symbols to 74LS244
Z80 processor RUN and HALT labels reversed
Z80 processor change D0-D3 to D4-D7 on U22 74LS670
Z80 processor R8 & R9 missing value labels
Z80 processor U6 reversed on back silkscreen
Z80 processor replace reset circuit with DS1233 (EconoReset)
Z80 processor update CPU-MAPPER GAL for I2C read and write fixes
Z80 processor requires updated U25 CPU-MAPPER GAL for I2C to function *and* U25 pins 13 and 14 connected
Z80 processor DMA D5 and D6 swapped in KiCAD symbol library
Z80 processor LEDs way, way too bright
Z80 processor J3 and J4 should be labelled 1-8 not 0-7

All boards label the GAL sockets with their GAL names (like CPU-MAPPER) in addition to the Uxx designation
