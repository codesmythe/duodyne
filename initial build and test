duodyne initial build and test findings

4-slot backplane power LED much too bright
ROMRAM memory configuration jumpers flipped on PCB
Z80 processor convert 74HCT244 symbols to 74LS244
Z80 processor RUN and HALT labels reversed
Z80 processor change D0-D3 to D4-D7 on U22 74LS670
Z80 processor R8 & R9 missing value labels
4-slot backplane power connectors to close to slot
Z80 processor U6 reversed on back silkscreen
Z80 processor replace reset circuit with DS1233 (EconoReset)
Z80 processor update CPU-MAPPER GAL for I2C read and write fixes
All boards label the GAL sockets with their GAL names (like CPU-MAPPER) in addition to the Uxx designation
ROMRAM order the I2C jumper blocks the same as the I2C sockets -- would be even better if they could be made proximate
Z80 processor requires updated U25 CPU-MAPPER GAL for I2C to function *and* U25 pins 13 and 14 connected
